## üåü Usage

1. Enter the name of a city in the input field and click "Get Weather."
2. View the weather details displayed in a card format, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition.
3. Enjoy dynamic animations (e.g., snowflakes for snow, raindrops for rain) based on the weather condition.
4. (Optional) Use the "Detect Location" feature to automatically fetch weather data for your current location.

## üîß API Integration

The app uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch real-time weather data. The following endpoints are used:

- **Current Weather**: `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`
- **5-Day Forecast (Optional)**: `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast`

#### Example API Response
```json
{
    "name": "New York",
    "main": {
        "temp": 15,
        "humidity": 60
    },
    "weather": [
        {
            "description": "clear sky",
            "icon": "01d"
        }
    ],
    "wind": {
        "speed": 3.6
    }
}
```
